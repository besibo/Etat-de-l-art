	Abstract = {Abstract Jumbo squid, Dosidicus gigas, is commercially important species in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, principally in the Northern Humboldt Current System where is notably abundant. In this area, jumbo squid display difference in density at geographical level, in size of mature individuals and inter-annual demographic fluctuation. Thereby, a population genetics study of jumbo squid in this location is needed especially for fisheries management. This study evaluated the population genetic of this squid (n = 120) based on novel microsatellite loci and 675 bp of the mtDNA \{ND2\} divided into two groups according to the Geographical density and Size at maturity. Our results at nuclear loci showed an overall low genetic diversity and no signatures of genetic differentiation of any group. At mtDNA loci level, low but significant genetic differentiation were detected between Small (n = 33) and Large (n = 39) populations. The low genetic diversity is more likely explained by a historical demographic expansion whereas the contradictory results of population structure may be due to the low number of microsatellite loci in HWE, different maternal history of this species or the different influence of genetic drift on mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Furthermore, demographic history analysis suggested that jumbo squid population went through a period of pure demographic expansion over the last 50,000 years ago. This study provides results of combined nuclear and mtDNA molecular markers that was never reported before and may represent a valuable information for the monitoring of the population genetic of this species. },

@article{Lane:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Abstract A 488 base pair portion of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequence from 294 individuals, and genotypes from 259 individuals using nine polymorphic microsatellite DNA loci, were used to investigate the phylogeography and population genetic structure of hapuku Polyprion oxygeneios from around New Zealand. The mtDNA data failed to detect any significant level of differentiation among sample sites. However, the microsatellite DNA analyses showed that individuals sampled from the west coast of the South Island (Hokitika) were genetically distinct from individuals sampled at all other New Zealand sites. These two groups might be representative of two separate populations of P. oxygeneios within New Zealand's Exclusive Economic Zone. Our results suggest that the west coast South Island P. oxygeneios fishery should continue to be managed as a separate stock.},
